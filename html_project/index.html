    <p>
        We all have dreams and most of us work hard to fulfill them. Our dreams are mostly fuelled by brilliant advertising and alluring
        marketing efforts by aspirational brands. While some of these must-haves come dirt cheap, there are a few others
        that cost a lot more than our means.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, if you listen to what elders say, then it would be better to save your hard earned money for a rainy day. But this would
        mean that you let go of your wishes like burying the latest smartphone or the compelling voice-controlled assistant
        device, you've wanted to get your hands on. While it is okay to splurge and get something luxurious once in a while,
        make sure that it is indeed worth the money spent.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, each time you plan to buy a luxury product so that you are not behind from your peers or just to be the center of attraction,
        stop. Take some time out and re-consider your decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are a few points that you should contemplate before making that big splurge.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The need
            <p>
                First and foremost, you should consider how necessary is the product for you. Think of the real reason why you are buying
                it. Is it because you are passionate about it? Is it because it would make your life much easier? Or, is
                it a long cherished dream? If it is one of the above reasons, then you can consider going the lengths. However,
                if it is simply a status symbol, the sheen of the product will die before you even realise it and there will
                be another new product crying for attention.
            </p>
        </li>
        <p>Now, consider if you can save the money to buy something worthwhile later?</p>
        <li>
            The money
            <p>
                Luxury products can burn a hole in your pocket as well as your savings. Consider the amount of money that you have and whether
                this would be enough to make the purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, you have an option to buy luxury items in monthly installments, but does it mean you will have to pay a small
                chunk of your earnings towards it.
            </p>
            <p>So, before you jump your guns and take the big step, spare some thought for your finances. If you feel that you
                can afford the product without landing in a financial quandary, then you can go ahead and make the splurge.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            The necessity
            <p>
                A need is one thing and entirely different from necessity. Consider how vital this luxury product is in your life. Will it
                change the course of your life? Is it not possible to go forth in your life without this product? Is it really
                a make or break situation? Is it something that you need urgently? In case you answer in the affirmative,
                then it may be worthwhile to buy the product. However, luxury products are usually not a necessity which
                is why they are named so. Thus, think before you splurge.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            The trend
            <p>
                Most luxury items are simply a trend that changes in a matter of time when a newer version of your product is made available.
                Moreover, as a modern versions hit the market, the previous version diminishes in value. Do you really want
                to be a part of this rat race where you may end up paying a huge sum for something that would come down to
                a lower price in the next few months? This is something you should consider since you are breaking the bank
                to buy the product.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
